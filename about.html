            My team members and I worked on this film, and made it from start to finish in only 30 minutes. We wanted to
            depict the stress of course registration in an exagerrated and humorous way. We used sound effects and music
            to show the time pressure and the implication that your course selection can have on your future. We really
            enjoyed making the film, from acting in it, to editing the clips and adding sounds. We hope you enjoyed
            watching the film!
